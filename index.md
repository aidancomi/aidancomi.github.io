# Welcome to Aidan's Coding Projects!

Thanks for checking out my projects!

I don't have much so far, but I'm working everyday to work more.

## [Project](https://whatchristmaseveisit.com): What Christmas Eve is It

Coded in JS and HTML in 1-2 hours as my first project with JS/HTML. Excited to learn even more!

## [Project](https://clearyourcookiesandcache.com): Clear your Cookies and Cache

This was quickly created to detect the browser and forward to the correct support page. This is open-source and can be found [here](https://github.com/aidancomi/clearyourcookiesandcache)

## [Project](https://comi.page/example): Pages Site

This is hosted as a hidden repository on Github via Github Pages for giving random projects (videos, presentations, etc) their own page.

## [Project](https://chrisprattisnowplaying.com): Chris Pratt is Now Playing

This was quickly built after the announcement of Chris Pratt playing Mario and is [fully open-source](https://github.com/aidancomi/chrisprattisnowplaying)! You can find more info in the [README](https://github.com/aidancomi/chrisprattisnowplaying#readme) on the Repository!

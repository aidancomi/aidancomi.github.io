# Welcome to Aidan's Portfolio Site!

This site is used to track my coding projects and as a portfolio to show what I've done!

## [Project](https://whatchristmaseveisit.com): What Christmas Eve is It

Coded in JS and HTML in 1-2 hours as my first project with JS/HTML. Excited to learn even more!

## [Project](https://clearyourcookiesandcache.com): Clear your Cookies and Cache

This was quickly created to detect the browser and forward to the correct support page. This is open-source and can be found [here](https://github.com/aidancomi/clearyourcookiesandcache)

## [Project](https://comi.page/example): Pages Site

This is hosted as a hidden repository on Github via Github Pages for giving random projects (videos, presentations, etc) their own page.

## [Project](https://comi.page/dvd/): DVD QR Code

Inspired by the [Coinbase Superbowl Ad](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/13/22932397/coinbases-qr-code-super-bowl-ad-app-crash), I created a site to recreate that with a QR code to my site instead. The DVD bouncing was built by [Stephen Zungia](https://codepen.io/stezu/pen/DyGWrV).

## [Project](https://chrisprattisnowplaying.com): Chris Pratt is Now Playing

This was quickly built after the announcement of Chris Pratt playing Mario and is [fully open-source](https://github.com/aidancomi/chrisprattisnowplaying)! You can find more info in the [README](https://github.com/aidancomi/chrisprattisnowplaying#readme) on the Repository!

## [Project](https://github.com/aidancomi/r-placebot): r/Place Discord Bot

This was my first discord bot and is designed to help discord communities for r/Place. It will search for any messages that contain what it suspects are coordinates, ex (543, 221).  This bot was built in Python and hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/@aidancomi/rPlace-Bot).
